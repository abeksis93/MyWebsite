# Abuela Susana

I decided to make a website for my grandmother who lives in Argentina.

- Website is in Hebrew.
- Every clickable button is marked with a cursor pointer when hovering.
- Every link will be opened in a new tab.
- Clicking the logo on the menu will scroll up to the top of the page.
- Hovering over the images will enlarge them.
